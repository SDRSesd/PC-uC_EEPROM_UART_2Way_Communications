# EEPROM UART Communication Between PC and Arduino (ATmega328P)

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates two-way communication between a PC and an Arduino UNO via UART, storing received data in the Arduinoâ€™s EEPROM. The PC transmits data in chunks of 1024 bytes using Python, while the Arduino receives this data, stores it in its EEPROM, and prints the data along with real-time transmission speed (in bps) on the serial monitor.

# Components Required
Arduino UNO (ATmega328P)
USB cable (for power and communication)
PC with Python 3.x
Python pyserial library: Used for serial communication


# Hardware Setup
Connect the Arduino UNO to the PC using a "CP2102 USB to UART Bridge converter". The USB connection will handle both power and UART communication.
The UART pins (TX/RX) on the Arduino are handled internally by the USB-to-serial interface, so no external wiring is necessary.

# Software Setup
CP2102 USB to UART brider driver installation - https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
Arduino IDE
Python 3.x
Download Python from the official Python website.

# Python Libraries
Install the pyserial library by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install pyserial

# Future Enhancements
Error Checking: Implement CRC or checksum to verify data integrity.
Higher Baud Rates: Optimize for higher transmission speeds.
Memory Management: Implement paging techniques to handle larger data storage.
GUI: Develop a graphical interface for easier data transmission.


# Note:
  This project is still under progress. Major part is completed & now I'm working on formatting the output to display in User readable format.
